## Oscillator Subcircuit 

## Filter Subcircuit 

## Delay Subcircuit 

The delay of the SQUID-6 is achieved in hardware using a chip called the PT2399. Originally designed in the late 1980ties by Princeton Technology Corp. for the commercial electronics industry the PT2399 found a second life amoungst guitar pedal and synthesizer enthusiasts.

The PT2399 can provide a delay between 38.5-342ms (it can be pushed beyond this if distortion isn't a problem for the application).

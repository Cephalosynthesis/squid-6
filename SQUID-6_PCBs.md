# Upper PCB

The upper PCB is where most of the action is. It is home to the power, oscillators, filter, and delay circuits.

## Power 

## Oscillator Subcircuit 

## Filter Subcircuit 

## Delay Subcircuit 

The delay of the SQUID-6 is achieved in hardware using a chip called the PT2399. Originally designed in the late 1980ties by Princeton Technology Corp. for the commercial electronics industry the PT2399 found a second life among guitar pedal and synthesizer enthusiasts.

The PT2399 can provide a delay between 38.5-342ms (it can be pushed beyond this if distortion isn't a problem for the application). 


# Lower PCB

The lower PCB provides connections for SQUID's 6 keys (and associated control pots), along with the modulation switch and BIG mod wheel.
